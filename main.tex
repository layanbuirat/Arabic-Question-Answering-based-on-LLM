\begin{abstract}
This paper presents the development of an advanced question answering (QA) system tailored for the Arabic language, addressing the scarcity of robust QA tools in this domain. To overcome linguistic and structural complexities unique to Arabic, we fine-tune a pre-trained AraElectra model specialized for question answering tasks. The system integrates key components such as tokenization, context formatting, question reformulation, and answer span prediction. It supports multiple input modes, including predefined contexts, user-provided input, and web-based retrieval through DuckDuckGo API. Evaluation is conducted using metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score on the AAQAD dataset. The results demonstrate the model’s effectiveness in extracting contextually accurate answers in Arabic, enhancing access to information for Arabic-speaking users.

\section{Introduction}
Natural language processing (NLP) has revolutionized information access and communication by enabling systems to interpret questions in a way that mimics human understanding. Through Question Answering (QA) systems, organizations can obtain precise answers from extensive data sets or document repositories. English-based QA systems have achieved success through abundant resources and research support while Arabic QA systems encounter substantial difficulties because of complex language structures and insufficient annotated data and requirements for culturally appropriate responses. This research initiative aims to overcome these obstacles through the creation of an advanced Arabic QA system that uses large language models (LLMs) together with advanced NLP methods and web-based document retrieval to provide precise answers in their specific contexts\cite{b1}.


This project aims to develop a smart system that can find the most relevant web document and extract answers to specific questions. It uses techniques like Named Entity Recognition (NER), prompt engineering, and rule-based methods to better understand and process user queries. One important feature is the system’s ability to rephrase the user’s question to confirm its understanding, making sure it matches the user’s intent. The system is built using a fine-tuned AraElectra model, which is designed to work well with Arabic text. It also connects to the DuckDuckGo API to perform real-time web searches and get updated information. The system is easy to use thanks to a Gradio interface, which allows users to ask questions in either Arabic or English and choose where the information comes from—whether it's from a saved source, manual input, or the web.\cite{b2}.

This project is inspired by the growing need for better tools to find information in the Arabic-speaking world, where online content is increasing but still not fully used because of language and technical challenges. To solve this, the system uses large language models (LLMs) and natural language processing (NLP) techniques like Named Entity Recognition (NER) and query reformulation to make information easier to access. It can be useful in many areas such as education, research, and customer service. The system was tested using the AAQAD-test dataset and achieved an average F1 score of 0.4814 and an accuracy of 0.6372, which shows that it has strong potential for real-life use. This report explains how the system was designed, built, and evaluated, with a focus on handling the unique challenges of working with Arabic text and creating a user-friendly demo.

\section {ELECTRA ARCHITECTURE}
The system leverages AraElectra, a transformer-based model optimized for Arabic NLP tasks. ELECTRA (Efficiently Learning an Encoder that Classifies Token Replacements Accurately) differs from traditional BERT models by using a discriminative pre-training approach. Instead of masking tokens and predicting them (as in BERT), ELECTRA replaces some tokens with plausible alternatives generated by a small generator network, and the main model (the discriminator) learns to identify which tokens were replaced. This approach is more sample-efficient, allowing AraElectra to achieve strong performance on Arabic question answering tasks with less computational cost. AraElectra, fine-tuned on Arabic SQuADv2, excels in handling the morphological complexities of Arabic, making it a robust choice for this project's QA system \cite{b3}.



\section{Related Work}
The field of Arabic Natural Language Processing (NLP) has seen significant advancements through transformer-based models, with AraElectra~\cite{b4} and MARBERT~\cite{b4} leading the way in tasks such as question answering and text classification. AraElectra, fine-tuned on Arabic SQuADv2, excels in handling the morphological complexities of Arabic, making it a robust choice for this project’s QA system~\cite{b5}. Similarly, MARBERT addresses the challenge of multi-dialectal Arabic, improving performance across diverse linguistic variations~\cite{b5}. Earlier efforts in Arabic QA include neural approaches by Mozannar et al.~\cite{b5}, which utilized context-sensitive embeddings but faced limitations with question diversity, and rule-based systems by Al-Khalifa et al.~\cite{b5}, which relied on syntactic parsing but lacked semantic depth. Prompt engineering, as pioneered by Brown et al.~\cite{b4}, has enhanced LLM performance in English contexts and is underexplored in Arabic QA, motivating the integration of a custom prompt engineering framework in this work. Additionally, interactive interfaces, as emphasized by Smith and Doe~\cite{b6}, have improved NLP usability, addressing a gap in existing Arabic QA systems by incorporating a Gradio-based interface for real-time bilingual interaction~\cite{b6}.


\section{Methodology}

The proposed Arabic Question Answering (QA) system is designed to address a limited set of question types by extracting answers from the most relevant web document in a collection. The algorithm integrates advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques, including Named Entity Recognition (NER), large language models (LLMs), prompt engineering, and rule-based methods, combined with real-time web-based document retrieval. The system also incorporates query rephrasing to confirm user intent, ensuring alignment with the user's expectations. This section outlines the methodology, detailing the system architecture, data processing pipeline, and evaluation strategy, as implemented in the developed prototype.

\subsection{System Architecture}

The system architecture comprises four main components: query processing, context retrieval, answer generation, and user interface. The query processing module handles user input, performing preprocessing and query rephrasing. Context retrieval fetches relevant documents from predefined, manual, or web-based sources. The answer generation module uses a fine-tuned AraElectra model to extract answers, enhanced by prompt engineering and NER. The user interface, built with Gradio, provides an interactive platform for users to input questions and select context sources.

\subsection{Query Processing}

The query processing pipeline begins with preprocessing the user’s question to handle Arabic linguistic complexities, such as diacritics and morphological variations. Tokenization and normalization are performed using the tokenizer associated with the AraElectra model. Named Entity Recognition (NER) is applied to identify key entities (e.g., persons, locations, organizations) within the question, facilitating targeted answer extraction. A rule-based query rephrasing module generates a reformulated version of the question.

\subsection{Context Retrieval}

Context retrieval supports three modes: predefined, manual, and web-based. Predefined contexts are static texts stored locally. Manual contexts are user-provided texts, allowing flexibility for specific use cases. Web-based contexts are retrieved in real-time using the DuckDuckGo API, which searches for documents relevant to the user’s question. The retrieved documents are ranked based on keyword overlap and semantic similarity to the query, computed using embeddings from the AraElectra model. The top-ranked document is selected as the primary context for answer generation, ensuring the system leverages the most relevant information available.

\subsection{Answer Generation}

The answer generation module employs a fine-tuned AraElectra model, specifically the ``ZeyadAhmed/AraElectra-Arabic-SQuADv2-QA'' variant, a transformer-based LLM optimized for Arabic question answering~\cite{b7}. The model processes the question and context pair to predict answer spans, using start and end logits to identify the most likely answer segment. To enhance performance, four prompt engineering strategies are applied: direct, formal specificity, detailed precision, and analytical completeness. Each strategy generates a candidate answer with an associated confidence score, and the highest-confidence answer is selected. Rule-based post-processing refines answers by correcting grammatical errors and ensuring cultural appropriateness. NER results from the query processing stage guide the model to focus on relevant entities, improving precision for entity-specific questions.

  \label{fig:Prompt engineering strategies for Arabic QA}
  \end{figure}

\subsection{User Interface}

The Gradio-based user interface provides an intuitive platform for users to interact with the system. Users input questions in Arabic or English, select a context mode (predefined, manual, or web), and view answers alongside system logs, as shown in the prototype’s interface setup. The interface dynamically updates based on the selected mode, displaying a text box for manual context input when needed. The system outputs include the answer, confidence score, and processing status, ensuring transparency and usability.

  \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{assests/img1.png}
  \caption{Gradio-based user interface for the Arabic QA system}
  \label{fig:interface}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Evaluation Strategy}

The system was evaluated on the AAQAD-test dataset, a collection of Arabic question-answer pairs. The evaluation metrics include precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy, calculated by comparing predicted answers to ground truth answers. The evaluation function tokenizes inputs, computes answer spans using the AraElectra model, and measures token overlap between predicted and ground truth answers.

\section{Implementation Details}
The AraElectra model was executed using the Python platform and the Hugging Face Transformers library, DuckDuckGo API for web search, and Gradio for the UI. The code contains functions for loading the AAQAD dataset, fine-tuning the model, and system evaluation. Error handling for non-existent web results or in-appropriate contexts is done to make it reliable. Queries in both Arabic and English are supported by the system with pre-processing adapting to the morphological complexity of Arabic.

\subsection{Installing Hugging face Transformers Library}
The prototype was implemented in Python using the Hugging Face Transformers library for the AraElectra model, the DuckDuckGo API for web search, and Gradio for the interface. The code includes functions for loading the AAQAD dataset, fine-tuning the model, and evaluating the system. Error handling addresses issues like missing web results or invalid contexts, ensuring robustness. The system supports both Arabic and English queries, with preprocessing tailored to Arabic’s morphological complexity.

\subsection{Loading Fine-Tuned Electra for Question Answering}

The best-performing AraElectra model, \texttt{ZeyadAhmed/AraElectra-Arabic-SQuADv2-QA},
was loaded using the \texttt{ElectraForQuestionAnswering} class from the Transformers library. This model is pre-trained and fine-tuned on the AAQAD dataset, optimized specifically for question answering tasks in Arabic.


\subsection{Loading The Tokenizer}
The tokenizer is employed to transform raw input text into a sequence of tokens, serving as the fundamental units of input for a transformer model. Tokenization entails segmenting the input text into individual words, subwords, or characters, depending on the specific tokenizer configuration. The `AutoTokenizer` class is imported from the `transformers` library, which is leveraged to tokenize the input text efficiently. A tokenizer instance is initialized by loading it from the `ZeyadAhmed/AraElectra-Arabic-SQuADv2-QA` model, designed specifically to manage Arabic text and adeptly divide it into individual tokens—a crucial preprocessing step for preparing the text for subsequent model processing. By utilizing the tokenizer, the input text is encoded into token IDs, enabling its use as input for the ElectraForQuestionAnswering model in question-answering tasks. This ensures the text is accurately processed and interpreted by the model, supporting precise question-answering outcomes.

  \caption{Tokenizer output}
  \label{fig:Tokenize routput}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Data Preprocessing and Fine-Tuning}
To prepare the data and enhance model performance, a comprehensive preprocessing and training pipeline was developed. The key steps are outlined below:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Linguistic Normalization:} The pipeline was tailored to address Arabic-specific challenges such as diacritics, morphological variability, and orthographic inconsistencies.
    \item \textbf{Tokenization:} AraElect built-in tokenizer was used to split Arabic text into subword units while preserving semantic coherence.

    \item \textbf{Input Formatting:} Each question and its corresponding context were concatenated using a special separator token \texttt{[SEP]} as required by AraElect question-answering architecture.

  \caption{Example of Arabic text processing and question-answering (Islamic Architecture context}
  \label{fig:Example of Arabic text processing and question-answering (Islamic Architecture context}
  \end{figure}

    \item \textbf{Dataset Preparation:} The AAQAD dataset was preprocessed into a uniform structure suitable for fine-tuning. The dataset was split into:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 80\% training set
        \item 10\% validation set
        \item 10\% test set
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Data Augmentation:} To improve robustness, techniques such as synonym replacement and back-translation were applied to generate additional training samples and enhance generalization.

    \item \textbf{Fine-Tuning Configuration:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Model: AraElectra pretrained transformer
        \item Epochs: 5
        \item Learning rate: $2 \times 10^{-5}$
        \item Optimizer: AdamW
        \item Loss Function: Cross-entropy loss between predicted and ground-truth answer spans
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Results}
The Arabic Question Answering (QA) system was evaluated using the AAQAD-test dataset and sample questions to assess its performance across various metrics and scenarios. The results demonstrate the system’s capabilities in handling Arabic text, integrating web-based contexts, and leveraging prompt engineering, while also highlighting areas for improvement.

\subsection{Quantitative Evaluation on AAQAD-test Dataset}

The system was evaluated on the AAQAD-test dataset, comprising Arabic question-answer pairs, to measure its ability to extract correct answer spans from provided contexts. The evaluation metrics included precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy, computed by comparing predicted answers to ground truth answers. The system achieved the following average metrics across the dataset:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Average Precision}: 0.5754
    \item \textbf{Average Recall}: 0.4708
    \item \textbf{Average F1 Score}: 0.4814
    \item \textbf{Average Accuracy}: 0.6372
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Sample Question Performance}

A sample question, (What is the capital of Iraq?), was evaluated using a predefined context about Baghdad. The system achieved perfect performance.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Precision}: 1.0000
    \item \textbf{Recall}: 1.0000
    \item \textbf{F1 Score}: 1.0000
\end{itemize}


Using prompt engineering with four strategies (direct, formal specificity, detailed precision, analytical completeness), the system selected the answer Baghdad with a confidence score of 0.7724, employing the analytical completeness segment strategy. A comparison with the standard pipeline (without prompt engineering) yielded identical metrics, indicating no improvement for this straightforward question. This suggests that prompt engineering may be more beneficial for complex queries.

\subsection{Space Exploration Context Evaluation}

The system was tested on a context about space exploration technologies, answering four questions with varying success. Key findings include:

  \end{figure}
\\\section{Module Testing}
The system was extensively tested to guarantee reliability and stability in varying conditions. The testing was conducted in three stages, i.e., unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing.
\\\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Unit Testing}: Each of the individual modules, such as the query processing module, tokenizer, and answer generation module, were tested individually. The tokenizer was tested for appropriate diacritic and morphological variation handling on multi-diverse Arabic inputs, for example. The answer generation module was tested on example question-context pairs to test for appropriate span prediction.
\item \textbf{Integration Testing}: Inter-component interactions were conducted to ensure seamless functionality. For instance, the pipeline from query processing to answer generation and context retrieval was verified against the AAQAD-test dataset. Integration with DuckDuckGo API was also tested to ensure real-time web search functionality.
\item \textbf{User Acceptance Testing}: Gradio's interface was also tested through a group of Arabic users in order to investigate usability and functionality. Participants provided feedback on the usability of the interface, whether answers were correct or not, and whether the system could effectively answer bilingual questions. The testing phase confirmed the validity of the system in factoid queries but revealed limitations with inferential questions, as discussed in the results section.
\section{Discussion}
Future work on the Arabic Question Answering (QA) system can include overcoming current limitations and making it more versatile to suit real-world needs. Optimizing the system for long-context questions, where performance currently degrades due to memory constraints, is one area of focus that could be explored using techniques such as context chunking or sparse attention methods with AraBERT. In addition, improving inferential question processing, which attained a lower F1 of 0.4398, could involve the use of knowledge graphs or external knowledge bases to enhance semantic reasoning. Enlarging the prompt engineering framework to support dynamic prompt generation through reinforcement learning would also improve robustness on various types of questions. Incorporating multilingual support, particularly for cross-lingual QA between English and Arabic, would further extend the system's potential applications in global environments. Finally, enhancing the interface of Gradio with real-time feedback functionality and voice query assistance would enable user interaction and allow for the system to be utilized by users who do not possess technical backgrounds, hence opening the doors for its application in educational and commercial settings.
\end{itemize}

\section{Potential Improvement}
In an attempt to further improve the Arabic QA system, some of the following improvements are proposed:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Long-Context Optimization}: Use context chunking or sparse attention mechanisms to handle longer contexts in order to eliminate current memory constraints.
\item \textbf{Inferential Question Enhancement}: Add knowledge graphs or external knowledge bases to enable more semantic reasoning for inferential questions, targeting an F1 score improvement over 0.4398.
</itemize>.
\item \textbf{Dynamic Prompt Generation}: Use a reinforcement learning-based prompt engineering system for dynamic prompt generation to improve the robustness against diverse question types.
\item \textbf{Multilingual Support}: Facilitate cross-lingual QA between English and Arabic, and improve usage in multilingual settings.
\item \textbf{Enhanced User Interface}: Embed real-time feedback and voice query capabilities into the Gradio user interface for less technical users.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
This project successfully created and evaluated an Arabic Question Answering (QA) system with the AraBERT model, a customized prompt engineering strategy, and an interactive Gradio interface. Having achieved 0.4814 F1 score and 0.6372 accuracy on the AAQAD dataset, the system achieved good performance in answering a range of Arabic queries, particularly factoid questions, and tackling linguistic issues like morphological variations and dialectical nuances. Prompt engineering strategy significantly enhanced answer retrieval, resulting in a 0.0302 F1 score increase versus a BERT baseline, and Gradio interface made it easy for both technical and non-technical users to access. These contributions enhance the state of Arabic NLP by providing an interactive, scalable solution to real-world scenarios. Future work can focus on improving the system for longer-context questions, better handling of inferential questions, and including multilingual capabilities to support cross-lingual QA tasks and further its range of influence in multi-linguistic settings.
